# 🧹 Sales Data Cleaning Script

This project focuses on cleaning a sample sales dataset using Python and the pandas library. The script performs a series of preprocessing tasks such as renaming columns, handling missing data, removing duplicates, and formatting values.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The script (`cleand.py`) performs the following operations:

1. **Loads the CSV file** using proper encoding (`ISO-8859-1`).
2. **Displays** the original column names, dataset shape, and first few rows.
3. **Cleans column headers** by:
   - Stripping spaces
   - Converting to lowercase
   - Replacing spaces and special characters with underscores
4. **Removes duplicate rows** and any rows with all missing values.
5. **Fills missing values**:
   - Numeric columns are filled with `0`
   - Categorical (object) columns are filled with `'unknown'`
6. **Standardizes text formatting** in all string columns (stripped and lowercased).
7. **Converts date columns** like `orderdate` to proper datetime format.
8. **Displays missing value summary** after cleaning.
9. **Saves the cleaned data** into `cleaned_sales_data.csv`.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library

You can install `pandas` via pip if you don't have it:

```bash
pip install pandas
Run the Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python cleand.py
Make sure sales_data_sample.csv is in the same folder as the script, or update the path accordingly in the script.

📈 Output
A cleaned version of the dataset: cleaned_sales_data.csv

Console output showing:

Original column names and shape

Cleaned column names

Missing value summary

🛠️ Future Improvements
Include more advanced outlier detection

Add data type validation

Visualizations for basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
